# Chapter 5 - Introduction to modules

We learn some basics about modules, how to use them, how to install them, etc.

## Summary

In this chapter, we discussed modules, such as finding all available or installed modules and how to install a new module. In this book, we will use a few dozen modules. Thus, an understanding of modules is vital. For example, a module called Matplotlib, which is useful in various graphs, will be used intensively in the next chapter, where we discuss the famous Black-Scholes-Merton option model.
In the next chapter, we will introduce the two most important modules: NumPy
and SciPy. Those two modules are used intensively for scientific and financial computation. In this book, many chapters depend on these two modules. In addition, many other modules depend on these two modules.
