# Chapter 2 - Using Python as an Ordinary Calculator

Pretty obvious if you have some experience with Python.

## Summary
In this chapter, we learned some basic concepts and several frequently used Python built-in functions such as basic assignment, precision, addition, subtraction, division, power function, and square root function. In short, we demonstrated how to use Python as an ordinary calculator to solve many finance-related problems.
For example, how to estimate the present value of one future cash flow, the future value of one cash flow today, the present value of a perpetuity, and the present value of a growing perpetuity. In addition, we discussed the dir(), type(), floor(), round(), and help() functions. We show how to get the list of all Python built-in functions and how to get help for a specific function.
Based on the understanding of the first two chapters, in the next chapter, Chapter 3, Using Python as a Financial Calculator, we plan to use Python as a financial calculator.
