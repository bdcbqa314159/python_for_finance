# Chapter 5 - 13 Lines of Python to Price a Call Option

Writing the famous pricing formula for a call option under Black-Scholes hypothesis.

## Summary

In this chapter, we deliberately avoided any mathematical formula related to the option theory. Thus, within a short period of time, such as less than two hours, a reader who has no clue about the option theory could price a European call option based on the famous Black-Scholes model.
In Chapter 5, Introduction to Modules, we will introduce modules formally, and it is the first chapter of a three-chapter block that focuses on modules. A module is a package or a set of programs written by one or a group of experts for a specific purpose.
For example, in Chapter 6, Introduction to NumPy and SciPy, we will show that five lines, instead of 13 lines, could be used to price a call option since we could use the cumulative standard normal distribution function contained in the SciPy module.
