# Python for finance

Here we just read the book - the first edition is quite old.
I would probably add some code after reading the latest second edition later but most of all themes on python are quite easy to understand when you have some experience with the language and in practical terms there are many tutorials on datacamp which already covers the topics within this book.
Book interesting though but you can't expect build a project from there.
